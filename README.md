# React + TypeScript + Vite Template

This template sets up a minimal React application with TypeScript, integrated with Vite for fast development, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and some basic ESLint rules to maintain code quality.

## Features:
- **React** with **TypeScript** for a type-safe development experience.
- **Vite** for fast builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- Basic **ESLint** rules for ensuring clean and consistent code.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally.

### 1. Clone Project & Install Dependencies
After cloning repository navigate to the folder called fitness-app running command: 
```bash
cd fitness-app
```

After that, install all necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm run install:all - to install all dependencies for backend and frontned
```

This will install all dependencies for backend and frontend part <br />
If some unexpected issues pops up, you must install separately dependencies for frontend and backend. <br />
First, inside project directory run command npm install - this will install backend dependencies <br />
After installation, go inside frontned directory by running command cd frontend, and then npm install for installing all necesary dependencies

### 2. Run the Development Server
After installation, you can start the development server. <br />


```bash
npm run dev - to run both servers
```
Same goes here. If some unexpected issues pops up, you must manually run both servers. <br />
For backend side, you need to use command: npm run start <br />
For frontend side, navigate inside frontend directory by running command cd frontned, and then npm run dev.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
### Frontend will be running on port 3000
### Backend will be running on port 5000
